This React Native bug is related to the usage of FlatList with a large dataset.  When the number of items exceeds a certain threshold (varies based on device and data complexity), FlatList becomes unresponsive and eventually crashes. The app may freeze, or you may encounter a blank screen or white screen of death. The specific error message might vary depending on where the crash occurs, but often involves `js exception`. This issue can arise even with optimizations like `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, or `removeClippedSubviews` enabled.
